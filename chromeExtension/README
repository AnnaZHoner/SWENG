   <---------------------------------------------- update log below ----------------------------------------------------->
 
Instelled JSLint on my machine. 
Deleted double defined var, changed type of dataurl to const, merged the redundant "showWarnings" function.
Removed the refresh button. Now it could automatically refresh itself every second.

Plan for the next update: After our alerts data be put into the Cloudant, I will let the extension keep reading the database.
Once it find the database was updated(if this is possible, else just try to read the database every second), it will then 
show the location, distressRatio and the tweets. Accroding to the distressRatio, there will be four levels of warning:

 -- when the distressRatio <30, a small green '!' will be showed
 -- when the distressRatio >30 && <70, a medium yellow '!' will be showed
 -- when the distressRatio >70, a big red '!' will be showed
 -- when the distressRatio >=100, it will pop up a window to tell the user to run.
